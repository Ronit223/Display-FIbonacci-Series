About the Code

First, we input two numbers as user's choice.Then we make the while loop at condition sum1 < 28000 (As the unsigned integer have the range from -32768 to +32767 ). After crossing the limit it will not proceed to the higher positive value.

Output:

0
1
1
2
3
5
..
...
...
17711
28657
Finished the code execution.

(sum = 17711) + (b = 28657 ) = 46368 > 32767, so at b = 28657,The code execution will stop. because in this case the while loop will not satisfy  the sum1 value.
